This is a timed multiple choice quiz built from JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The quiz is intended to test the users knowledge of Big10 school football teams. In building this application I was able to apply and familiarize myself with newly aquired JavaScript skills while also incorporating necessary HTML and CSS.
